#Lights Out

## The Game:

Lights Out is an electronic game, released by Tiger Toys in 1995 [1]. The game consists of a 5 by 5
grid of lights. When the game starts, a random number or a stored pattern of these lights is switched on.
Pressing any of the lights will toggle it and the four adjacent lights. The goal of the puzzle is to switch
all the lights off, preferably in as few button presses as possible

##Linear Algebra

The fact is that this game can be easily and effeciently solved by simple linear algebra: basics Gauss
elimination technique. An example of such strategy is described in [2] and the paper is available on the
course webpage.

##What do you have to do?

1. Read about the Lights Out game (there are many webpages) and the solving strategies with linear
algebra.
Then, write a report about what you have learned. Here, I just want the linear algebra point of
view.
2. Write a Matlab code that solve the game, given any intial configuration.
